                PRAIA - The Artificial Intelligence Research Center is an important partnership recently formalized between DCC/UFBA and several educational and research institutions in the Northeast to create an Advanced Research Center in Artificial Intelligence called PRAIA (Truly Applied Research Center in Artificial Intelligence). The center's mission is to serve as a hub integrating market and academia to increase business competitiveness, as well as help create new companies by fostering a deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence techniques and their potential applications in the public and private sectors. 

                In general, PRAIA follows four main guidelines: (i) conducting research that is truly market-oriented; (ii) network collaboration through good governance; (iii) financial sustainability independent of public funding; and (iv) prioritization of the Northeast region. To ensure the implementation of these guidelines, the center focuses on training professionals and providing consultancy services for developing creative solutions using AI to solve real-world problems.
