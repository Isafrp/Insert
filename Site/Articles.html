                <summary>Internet Architecture Evolution: Found in Translation</summary>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p><strong>Autores:</strong> Guilherme Ribeiro, Luis Pedrosa, Salvatore Signorello, Fernando M. V. Ramos</p>
                    <p><strong>Data:</strong> Maio de 2023</p>
                    <p>The success of the Internet is undeniable, but so are its limitations. Over the past two decades, the research community has responded with clean-slate redesigns, proposing innovative architectures focused on issues like security and information dissemination, among others. Unfortunately, these efforts have had limited impact on the commercial Internet, if any. The reason is that the Internet architecture is deeply entrenched, making a complete replacement elusive.</p>
                    <p>In this paper, we argue that a successful approach to evolving the Internet requires three key ingredients. It should (1) be backwards compatible with the current Internet, (2) evolve from the existing architecture, and (3) allow new architectures to reach their full potential. Recently, the community introduced an overlay-based approach for an Extensible Internet. We believe this is a clear step in the right direction: it is backwards-compatible, does not require replacing the current Internet infrastructure, and is deployable today. However, we contend that this approach is not fully adequate as it lacks the third requirement, which we deem crucial for new architectures to gain a foothold and grow. As an alternative, we advocate for a translation-based approach and present our rationale on how it may enable effective Internet evolution by meeting the three requirements above.</p>

                <summary>An Overview of Advanced Healthcare Services: Connectivity and Security in Assisted Living Systems</summary>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adriana Viriato Ribeiro, Fernando Nakayama, Michele Nogueira, Leobino Sampaio</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2023</p>
                    <p>The assisted living environment is an advanced healthcare service that includes applications in smart spaces and the monitoring of individuals' health regardless of their location. The development of these applications involves different technologies such as the Internet of Things, short- and long-range communication protocols, middleware, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. 
                    The heterogeneity of the components within these architectures and the communication protocols themselves creates challenges in meeting the networking and security requirements of these applications. 
                    This chapter provides an overview of this service, identifies the main communication and security requirements, and highlights the key challenges in addressing them.
