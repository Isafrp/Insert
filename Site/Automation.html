            <h1>Automation of Remote Security Bootstrapping Through Named-Data Networking (AFOSR - AFRL)</h1>
            <p>Leobino Nascimento Sampaio - Coordenador / Adriana Viriato Ribeiro - Integrante.</p>
            <p class="objective">
                The current IP's communication model is end-to-end, recipient-oriented, and path-based. These properties are harder to apply in dynamic environments featured by intermittent connectivity, dynamic topologies, and intense node mobility. When plugged into an IP network, the device's protocol stack requires a set of further connectivity configuration procedures to communicate with other nodes, carried out by infrastructure-based network services. IoT systems, however, present new mobility and security requirements that current infrastructure-based network services fail to address due to some reasons. Firstly, in dynamic environments, there is no guarantee that these services will be available when plugging a new device into the network. Secondly, IP forwarding is stateless and has no adaptability of its own, so requiring constant protocol configurations. Thirdly, node mobility demands a simple, flexible, and fast security configuration, not seen in current TLS/SSL-based solutions. Named Data Networking (NDN)'s built-in features can meet these requirements. It is a networked system formed by named entities through which the names stem from those used by applications with semantic meaning and its communication model focuses on the content itself (i.e., what) rather than its location (i.e., where), using directly secured data signed by data producers. However, the need for name assignments and trust configuration in deploying new entities in an NDN network requires systematic solutions to minimize manual operations during NDN configurationsin IoT environments, particularly those formed by remotely-located massive devices. Hence, this project aims to investigate trust management and configuration, remote security bootstrapping, and easy-to-use solutions to support NDN deployment in mobile IoT..
