                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Araújo, Maycon Peixoto, Leobino Sampaio</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2023</p>
                    <p>The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is highly suitable for vehicular applications and inter-vehicular communication (IVC). To facilitate experimentation with Vehicular Named-Data Networking, we introduce NDN4IVC, an open-source simulation framework that enables more realistic application testing in VANETs. This framework allows real-time bidirectional communication between SUMO and NS3, providing deeper insights into road traffic and vehicular mobility.</p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Multiple Researchers</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 2023</p>
                    <p>Network Slicing (NS) is a key technique widely used in 5G computing strategies and Industrial IoT. The Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) architecture addresses the diversity of NS architectures by integrating experimental networks and enhancing NS with Machine Learning optimizations, energy-efficient slicing, and custom security features.</p>

                    <h2>NDN-Waze: A Distributed System for Vehicular Traffic Management via Named Data Networks</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Araújo, Leobino Sampaio</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2023</p>
                    <p>Many vehicular networks rely on IP-based models, which are not always secure or suitable. This paper proposes NDN-Waze, a fully distributed system for VANETs based on Named Data Networking (NDN). NDN-Waze serves as a proof-of-concept for vehicular route guidance applications. Simulation results show that NDN properties can outperform traditional IP-based data forwarding in VANETs.</p>

                    <h2>Internet Architecture Evolution: Found in Translation</h2>
                    <p><strong>Autores:</strong> Guilherme Ribeiro, Luis Pedrosa, Salvatore Signorello, Fernando M. V. Ramos</p>
                    <p><strong>Data:</strong> Maio de 2023</p>
                    <p>The success of the Internet is undeniable, but so are its limitations. Over the past two decades, the research community has responded with clean-slate redesigns, proposing innovative architectures focused on issues like security and information dissemination, among others. Unfortunately, these efforts have had limited impact on the commercial Internet, if any. The reason is that the Internet architecture is deeply entrenched, making a complete replacement elusive.</p>
                    <p>In this paper, we argue that a successful approach to evolving the Internet requires three key ingredients. It should (1) be backwards compatible with the current Internet, (2) evolve from the existing architecture, and (3) allow new architectures to reach their full potential. Recently, the community introduced an overlay-based approach for an Extensible Internet. We believe this is a clear step in the right direction: it is backwards-compatible, does not require replacing the current Internet infrastructure, and is deployable today. However, we contend that this approach is not fully adequate as it lacks the third requirement, which we deem crucial for new architectures to gain a foothold and grow. As an alternative, we advocate for a translation-based approach and present our rationale on how it may enable effective Internet evolution by meeting the three requirements above.</p>
